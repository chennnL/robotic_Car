Ultrasonic Sensor: HC-SR04

The user manual for this sensor can be found here: https://web.eece.maine.edu/~zhu/book/lab/HC-SR04%20User%20Manual.pdf

## Objective

The goal of this project is to use the ultrasonic sensor as a form of obstacle detection to aid the robotic car as it traverses through a maze. The sensor will constantly shoot out 10 microsecond pulses at an interval of 60 milliseconds; the duration of those pulses will be stored and used to calculate the distance.
