# Ultrasonic (HC-SR04)

The user manual for this sensor can be found here: https://web.eece.maine.edu/~zhu/book/lab/HC-SR04%20User%20Manual.pdf

## Objective

The goal of the ultrasonic sensor is to aid the robotic car as it traverses through a maze using object detection. The sensor will constantly shoot out 10 microsecond pulses at an interval of 60 milliseconds; the duration of those pulses will be stored and used to calculate the distance.

# Accelerometer (MPU6050)

The user manual for this sensor can be found here: https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf

## Objective

The objective of the accelerometer is to detect and measure the height of the hump. By making use of Moving Average, we were able to manipulate the raw data that was initially displayed to display out values equating to the distance. We made use of Raspberry Pico for the accelerometer.
